Map-your-friend is a open web app that displays user's current location and also location of the users who are using this app.

It is used to locate friends, track them, guide them and almost every thing to spot them.

The project is organised in to folders .

1. "src" is the main folder which contains the source files for the project.

2. In the database.php file we have to fill the options of the database connectivity parameters(ex : locahost(server) username and password of mysql).

3. The project resources are placed under "res" folder.


To install , copy the files in the web folder of PHP server used.

Create a database name called "MFY".

Import the "users.sql" file to database "MFY". 

That should get to run the project.
